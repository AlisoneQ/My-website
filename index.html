          <h2>About me:</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a developer from Poland currently undertaking classes to enhance
            my skills in web development and software engineering. My journey in
            programming started with the beginning of technical school, and
            since then, I have been continuously learning and growing in this
            field.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy creating and developing new projects, as
            well as continuously learning and enhancing my programming skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer, mastering
            both front-end and back-end technologies. I am passionate about
            creating seamless user experiences and efficient, scalable systems.

          <h2>My programming experience:</h2>
          <p>
            Since I started with programming I caught a glimpse of a couple
            languages. That includes: Python, C++, Java, Kotlin, Lua, JavaScript, and pseudo languages like HTML and CSS. I'm still learning and
            this list might get longer in the future.

          <h2>Origin of my nickname:</h2>
          <p>
            I'm writing this because people sometimes mistake me for a female,
            thinking my nickname originates from the name "Alison". In reality,
            my nickname originates from Alan, which at a young age I transformed
            into Alison, not knowing it was a female name. I used Alison as my
            nickname for a few years before adding 'Q' to the end became popular
            in my country. I decided to keep it as it is and use it as my
            nickname on the internet.
