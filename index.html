                <h2>About me:</h2>
                <p>I'm a developer from Poland currently undertaking classes to enhance my skills in web development and
                    software engineering. My journey in programming started with the beggining of technical school, and
                    since then, I have been continuously learning and growing in this field.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy creating and developing new projects, as well as continuously learning and
                    enhancing my programming skills.</p>
                <p>My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer, mastering both front-end and back-end
                    technologies. I am passionate about creating seamless user experiences and efficient, scalable
                    systems.</p>

                <h2>Origin of my nickname:</h2>
                <p>I'm writing this because people sometimes mistake me for a female, thinking my nickname originates
                    from the name "Alison". In reality, my nickname originates from Alan, which at a young age I
                    transformed into Alison, not knowing it was a female name. I used Alison as my nickname for a few
                    years before adding 'Q' to the end became popular in my country. I decided to keep it as it is and
                    use it as my nickname on the internet.
